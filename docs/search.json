    "text": "The sampling campaign took place from 16 July to 8 August 2024 in the Finnmark region in Northern Norway. From 20 to 25 July, a prospection campaign was conducted to find 5 sites with different geological parent material. Soil pits were established and greenhouse gas fluxes measured (CO2, CH4, N2O). From 27 July to 2 August, soil plot and biomass samples were taken and bioplots within the soil plots established.\nFive plots were established based on the units indicated in the geological map sheets (resolution 1:50,000), the vegetation cover (tree-free tundra), and landscape position (stable positions, not water-affected, representative). The sites were named after the geological map sheet and code in the respective sheet. An example: NNBF1 = NN [Northern Norway] + BF [map sheet Bekkarfjord] + 1 [code in Bekkarfjord map sheet]."
